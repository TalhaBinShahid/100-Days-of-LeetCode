# 💯 100 Days of LeetCode Challenge 💻

Welcome to my **100 Days of LeetCode Challenge**! 🚀

I am on a journey to solve 100 LeetCode problems in 100 days and improve my problem-solving skills. Each day, I will be solving a new coding problem and uploading the solution here. Alongside this, I will also be sharing my progress daily on LinkedIn.

## 📅 Challenge Breakdown:
- 🗓 **Start Date**: August 25, 2024
- 🏁 **End Date**: December 2, 2024
- 🔥 **Goal**: Solve 100 LeetCode problems in 100 days

## 📁 Repository Structure:
Each day's solution will be saved in a folder named `Day-X`, where `X` represents the day number of the challenge. The folder will contain:
- The problem statement
- The solution in code (usually in C++ and Python)
- A brief explanation of the approach taken

## 📝 How to Use This Repository:
1. Browse through the folders to find solutions for each day's challenge.
2. Each folder contains the source code and explanations for the respective problem.
3. Feel free to explore, clone, and suggest improvements via pull requests.
